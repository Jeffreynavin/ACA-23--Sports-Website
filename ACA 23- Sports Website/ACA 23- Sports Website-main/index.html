			<h1>Biography</h1>
			<p>Dhoni was born on July 7, 1981 in Ranchi, Bihar (now Jharkhand) to Pan Singh and Devaki Devi. He has a
				sister Jayanti and a brother Narendra Singh Dhoni. Originally his family belonged to village Lvali in
				the Lamgarha block of Almora district of Uttarakhand. He studied at the DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir School
				in Shyamali, Ranchi, Jharkhand. Initially, during his school days, he used to play badminton and
				football and in fact was the goalkeeper of his football team. Once he was sent by his football coach to
				play cricket for a local cricket club. It was in this match that he impressed everyone with his
				wicket-keeping skills which resulted in getting him a regular post of the wicketkeeper at the Commando
				Cricket Club (1995-1998). He was picked up for the Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship, where he
				performed well. Dhoni focused on cricket after passing his 10th standard. From 2001 to 2003, he worked
				as a Train Ticket Examiner (TTE) at the Kharagpur Railway Station under South Eastern Railway in
				Midnapore (W), a district in West Bengal.
				<br> <br>
				Dhoni began his career in 1998 by playing for Bihar U-19 team. He also played for East Zone U-19 for the
				CK Nayudu trophy team. In 1999-2000, he made a debut for Bihar in Ranji Trophy. Dhoni’s performance in
				the 2002–03 season included three half-centuries in the Ranji Trophy and a couple of half-centuries in
				the Deodhar Trophy, as he started gaining recognition for his lower-order contribution as well as
				hard-hitting batting style. His brilliant performances in the Deodhar Trophy, Duleep Trophy and India
				‘A’ tour of Kenya, brought him to the notice of the national team selectors. Dhoni’s talent was
				discovered via the BCCI’s small-town talent-spotting initiative Talent Resource Development Wing. Dhoni
				was discovered by TRDO Prakash Poddar, who saw Dhoni play for Jharkhand at a match in Jamshedpur in
				2003, and sent a report to the National Cricket Academy. He was recognised for his efforts in best
				wicket-keeping in the 2003/04 season, especially in the One Day format, and was picked for the India ‘A’
				squad for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya. He was then selected to play for the Indian Cricket team, after
				making a mark in the India A squad and in 2004, where he made his ODI debut against Bangladesh in
				Chittagong.

				Since then, Mahendra Singh Dhoni has come a long way in cricket. His sterling performances with the bat
				have rescued India from many a tight situation. In his illustrious career, Dhoni has played 90 Tests
				scoring 4876 runs with his highest being 224 against Australia at Chennai in 2013. His amazing
				statistics behind the stumps include 256 catches and 38 stumpings.

				In the ODI scenario, Dhoni has so far played 265 matches scoring 8620 runs, with his highest being a
				staggering 183 out off 145 balls not-out against Sri Lanka, in Jaipur, 2005-06. Dhoni ended the series
				with the highest run aggregate (346) and was awarded the Man of the Series award for his efforts. In
				December 2005, Dhoni was rewarded a B-grade contract by the BCCI. His ODI wicket-keeping statistics
				include 246 catches and 85 stumpings. Dhoni made his ICC Cricket World Cup debut in 2007 and played only
				three matches due to India’s early exit. India won the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 and 2011 ICC Cricket
				World Cup, among others, under his captaincy. India reached the finals in ICC World Cup 2011 with
				victories over Australia and Pakistan in quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively. Chasing a target
				of 275 in the final against Sri Lanka, Dhoni rescued his team alongside Gautam Gambhir, and later Yuvraj
				Singh, to help India lift their second World Cup title since 1983. He scored 91 not out, finishing the
				game with a historic six and claiming the Man of the Match award.

				He is also the captain of the Chennai Super Kings Team in IPL (Indian Premier League). Under his
				captaincy, the team has won three IPL titles and also the Champions League Twenty20 in 2010 and 2014.

				Winning the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. Dhoni became the first and only captain in international cricket
				to claim all ICC trophies. In November 2013, Dhoni became the second India batsman after Sachin
				Tendulkar to aggregate 1,000 or more ODI-runs against Australia. During the 2015 Cricket World Cup,
				Dhoni became the first Indian captain to win all group stage matches in such a tournament. Dhoni stepped
				down as captain of India in the limited over formats in January 2017. In April 2019, he was named in
				India’s squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. Dhoni was a part of India’s first ever Twenty20
				international match.
